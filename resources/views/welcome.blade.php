        <B>FAQ:</B>
        <br>
        <br>
        <B>1. Why should you choose CSGOUrban instead of other gambling sites?</B><br>
        - We do NOT take commission on withdrawing items from our site.<br>
        - We have highly qualified staff that can help you any time of day and night<br><br>

        <b>2. How do you login?</b><br>
        - You can login by clicking on the green "Sign in Through Steam" button in the top-right corner of the website.
        <br><br>

        <B>3. How do you contact staff members?</B><br>
        - You can contact support by emailing us at admin@csgourban.com<br>
        - If you are looking to be partners or you are a Youtuber/Streamer, contact us here:partnership@csgourban.com
        <br><br>

        <b> 4. I can't withdraw. Why?</b><br>
        - There may be four possible solutions to this problem:<br>
        路 To start withdrawing you need to deposit min 5000 diamonds ($5) on our site.<br>
        路 To start withdrawing you need to bet min 50000 diamonds all up.<br>
        路 You can withdraw only once per 24 hours. However, you may withdraw 10 items at a time.<br>
        路 You didn't set your trade URL or your account is suspended.<br><br>

        If you didn't find your solution here, please double check, then you may contact us.<br><br>

        <b> 5. Can I get my coins or skins refunded?</b><br>
        - Firstly, we DO NOT REFUND ANYTHING. Everything you're doing with your coins, skins or account is YOUR OWN
        RESPONSIBILITY.<br>
        - If our service had a bug please contact us through contact tab. Every email sent will be replied to in a
        maximum 72 hours.<br>
        - Every skin you deposited you confirmed with Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator therefore it is your fault if you
        lose them whilst gambling.<br><br>

        <b>6. How many diamonds do I receive for my skins?</b><br><br>
        - The conversion is $1 = 1000 diamond. Therefore $10 = 10000 diamonds and $100 = 100000.<br>
